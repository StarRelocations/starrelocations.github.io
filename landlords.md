			Does my property meet the requirements?
		</h2>
		<p>We typically take on properties with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 reception rooms. If your property doesn't quite match this specification it might still be worth getting in touch because sometimes we are able to make different configurations work.</p>

			My property is not in very good condition; can you still take it on?
		</h2>
		<p>Yes! We like working with properties in worse condition because they provide us with a blank canvas that we can tailor during our initial light refurbishment. So if your property is run down, has damp damage or smells, think of us!</p>

		</h2>
		<p>If your property is empty we can take it on in as little time as 24 hours and get your first payment sent to you the very same day!</p>

			Does my property have to be empty before you will take it on?
		</h2>
		<p>It is best if the property is empty, yes. If it is not, we can often arrange a compromise, depending on the type of tenant that currently lives in the house, how many rooms are occupied etc. Get in touch to find out more for specific situations such as this.</p>

			Will Star Relocations pay me a deposit?
		</h2>

			Are there any fees for me to pay?
		</h2>
		<p>Nope, there are no management fees and no tenant finding fees. We make our money from the difference between what our customers pay us and what we pay you. The only expense that you might incur are those of normal wear and tear. See the FAQ below for more information on this subject.</p>

			who pays for normal wear and tear maintenance?
		</h2>
		<p>Regular wear and tear that occurs as a result of a normal tenancy (and not a result from direct damage or negligence) is paid by you the landlord. As your property managers however, we will take care of the replacement, getting quotations, and supply you with justifications and proof of the expense.</p>

			Who pays for things damaged by tenants?

			what access will I as the landlord have to the property? 
		</h2>
		<p>If you want you can go years without having to step foot in the property. If you would like more control, you will be entitled to quarterly inspections throughout the building. It all depends on how much responsibility you want to take on.</p>

			What kind of tenants do you put in the property?
		</h2>
		<p>We only take on professionals, and sometimes mature students. The reason we limit ourselves to this demographic is because they cause fewer problems and generally have more respect for the property. Our goal is to have a tenancy that goes as smooth as possible.</p>

			What happens if the occupants don't pay?
		</h2>
		<p>In reality this very rarely happens due to the nature of the types of people we let live in the house. If it did happen, however, thanks to our rent guarentee, you would of course still be paid!</p>
